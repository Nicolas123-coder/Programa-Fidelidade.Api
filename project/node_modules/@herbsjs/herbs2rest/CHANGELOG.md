### Features

* **default controller:** better HTTP Status Code using Herbs Known Errors ([d87d59b](https://github.com/herbsjs/herbs2rest/commit/d87d59b331170a8f1da3e0bc1f4edfb0f35c25ea)), closes [#17](https://github.com/herbsjs/herbs2rest/issues/17)

* **default controller:** Step code using generic Err should work just fine. However, steps core that are
already returning Known Errors will change the behavior of the default controller and should expect
